## Course Maintenance Notice üöß

Please note that this **Deep Reinforcement Learning course is now in a low-maintenance state**. However, it **remains an excellent resource to learn both the theory and practical aspects of Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

Keep in mind the following points:

- *Unit 7 (AI vs AI)* : This feature is currently non-functional. However, you can still train your agent to play soccer and observe its performance.

- *Leaderboard* : The leaderboard is no longer operational.

Aside from these points, all theory content and practical exercises remain fully accessible and effective for learning.

If you have any problem with one of the hands-on **please check the issue sections where the community give some solutions to bugs**.
